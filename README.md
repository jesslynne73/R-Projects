## Welcome to Jess's page for R Projects and Data Analysis

I'll use this repository to share assignments and activities in support of R programming. You can view my extensive final project for STAT 184: Intro to R in my "World-Happiness-Data-Analysis" repository. This repository includes introductory R activities as well as statistical analysis projects I chose to complete in R after I had learned it.
